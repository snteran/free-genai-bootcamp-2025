Step	English (Guidance/Question)	Japanese Script	Romanized Japanese	Notes
1. Sentence Presentation	Our sentence to translate is: 'The cat sat on the mat.'			
2. Understanding Check	What are the key parts of this sentence? Who is doing what?			
	Excellent! And where is the cat sitting?			
	Perfect! So we know the subject is the cat, the action is sitting, and the location is the mat. 'On' tells us the relationship.			
3. Vocabulary Exploration	Do you know any Japanese words for 'cat'?	猫	neko	
	That's right! 'neko' is a common word for cat. How about 'sat'? Remember the nuance. For 'mat,' do you know any words?			Hint about nuances of "sit"
	No problem. Use a dictionary or Jisho.org. Search for 'mat' and different ways to say "sit."			Provide resources
4. Sentence Structure	How do you think the word order might be different in Japanese?			
	That's a good guess! Japanese often uses Subject-Object-Verb. Research particles like 'wa,' 'ga,' 'o,' and 'ni.' Location usually comes before the verb.			Hint about word order
5. Particle Practice	Let's use 'neko' for cat and 'za' for 'on the mat' (for now). Which particle might you use after 'neko' to indicate it's the subject?			Simplified "on the mat"
	That's a possibility! 'wa' and 'ga' can mark the subject. Look up their differences.			
6. First Attempt	What's your best guess for the Japanese translation?			
	That's a good first attempt! You used 'neko' and a particle. 'suwaru' works, but consider the nuance of sitting. Remember the word order. Is the location clear?			Feedback without giving the answer
7. Iteration/Refinement	(Student attempts again)			
	That's a definite improvement! 'ga' and 'suwatta' are good. 'ni' on 'za' is a step forward. "za" might be too direct. How to express "on the mat" more idiomatically?

8. Final Solution (Optional)	A natural translation: 'The cat sat on the mat.'	猫が椅子のうえに座った	neko ga zaisu no ue ni suwatta
